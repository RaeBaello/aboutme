            <p>
                If you are viewing this website, I feel it is safe to assume that you are a recruiter who has looked into my resume. First of all, 
                I want to thank you for your time. I want to take this chance to explain the big gap between my graduation and time of applying for
                jobs. I graduated in 2021, during the time when COVID was spreading all over the world. Unfortunately, the weekend before I was eligible
                to receive the vaccine, I was hopsitalized for almost a week due to COVID. I experienced all the symptoms the illness has to give.
                After a week in the hospital, I was lucky enough to survive and was discharged. I spent the following year working on my health to fully recover
                and enjoy the second chance at life. The year after that, my family planned a family reunion back in my home country, the Philippines. Therefore,
                I was hesitant to apply for jobs as I did not want the reunion to happen right after interviewing for jobs. Right after the trip, I
                went thru a training program provided by Revature in order to sharpen my programming skills. Now, I am trying to create projects to 
                apply for software engineering jobs. I did not share this experience with the intent to gain pity, but with the intent to be transparent to everyone.
                Life happens, and this experience fuels my passion to learn more and grow as a software developer.
