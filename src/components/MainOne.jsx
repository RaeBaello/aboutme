            <p className="MainOne--paragraph">Hi! I am Rae Mari Lennard Baello, but I just go by Rae. Welcome to my first React website! I am a Computer Science graduate from
            Rutgers-Newark/NJIT. This will be my first personal project. My future vision for this website is to update it with future projects that I will create and make the 
            website more aesthetically pleasing as I continue to grow my skills as a developer. To share some of my personal life, my favorite hobbies are playing volleyball and 
            playing games with my friends. I love the social aspect of both hobbies and having the opportunity to meet new people!
